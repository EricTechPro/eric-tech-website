# EricTech Website: BUILD/KILL Executive Summary

**Quick Decision Matrix** for product strategy prioritization.

---

## IMMEDIATE KILL DECISIONS ❌

### 1. Current Expertise Section (YouTube Links)
**Why Kill**: Sends 99% of traffic off-site, zero conversion
**Evidence**: 10K-58K YouTube views → <1% consultation bookings
**Cost**: $5K-10K/month lost revenue from uncaptured leads
**Action**: Replace with on-site CTAs (email capture, case studies, consultations)

### 2. "Tech Educator" Positioning
**Why Kill**: No courses exist yet → credibility gap
**Evidence**: Website promises education without deliverable content
**Cost**: Trust damage, confusion, visitor drop-off
**Action**: Change to "AI Automation Consultant & Career Strategist"

### 3. Generic Hero Section
**Why Kill**: Doesn't serve either audience (B2B or B2C)
**Evidence**: Mixed messaging reduces conversion for both segments
**Cost**: Confused visitors → higher bounce rate
**Action**: Split into dual value proposition (Companies vs Developers)

---

---

## COMPETITIVE MOAT STRATEGY

### Assets to Build
1. **Email List** (10K+ subscribers = defensible audience)
2. **Proprietary IP** (frameworks, methodologies, templates)
3. **Community** (network effects, retention, referrals)
4. **Content Library** (YouTube → courses → evergreen SEO)

### Threats to Monitor
1. **AI Tool Consolidation** → Platforms building native automation (reduce need for integrators)
2. **No-Code Proliferation** → Lower barrier = more competitors
3. **Budget Cuts** → Harder to sell consulting in recession

### Mitigation Tactics
- Diversify revenue (consulting + courses + community + products)
- Build platform presence (LinkedIn, Twitter, newsletter - not just YouTube)
- Partner strategically (n8n, Make, AI companies - affiliate deals)
- Focus on outcomes (not just tools - business results sell)

## FINAL DECISION: The Brutal Truth

**What's Working** (Double Down):
- YouTube authority (10K-58K views proves audience exists)
- AI automation expertise (market demand is HIGH)
- Dual audience potential (B2B + B2C both viable)
- Consultation infrastructure (calendar works, just needs positioning)

**What's Broken** (Fix This Week):
- Generic positioning (doesn't differentiate or convert)
- Traffic hemorrhage (99% of YouTube viewers leave without converting)
- No social proof (B2B needs case studies, B2C needs testimonials)
- Course illusion (educator without courses = credibility gap)

**What's Premature** (Don't Build Yet):
- Full course platform (no content ready for 3-6 months)
- Advanced automation (prove basic lead gen works first)
- Complex funnels (master email capture before optimization)

**The 80/20 Path**: Focus Week 1 on email capture + homepage clarity. These two changes alone could generate $2K-4K/month within 60 days by converting existing YouTube traffic into consultation bookings.

**First Action Tomorrow**: Create lead magnet landing page using existing GitHub automation templates. This single feature has the highest ROI (10/10 impact, 2/10 effort = 50 ROI score).
